This is an old abandoned project of mine I thought I'd release... source is included but it's ugly and hacked together (why I abandoned it!).

But it looks quite pretty and I'm quite proud of the level editor at any rate! So it would be a shame for it to rot on my harddrive forever without anyone seeing it ^_^

Requires some kind of shader support to run. Features per pixel point and hemisphere lighting! (ripped straight from the GLSL book!) Two executables, with and without bloom, obviously without bloom is much faster.

Use WASD to move, that's about it. You can pick up fuel cans (white square things) and carry them to the generator (white cylinder thing) in order to start it up so that the lift will function. If you fall from a higher to a lower platform the lift will come back down. Turn on the sound for some SFX!

To access the level editor press E.
From there, hold the right mouse button to move the camera. Left click to select stuff, move selected things with WASD, RF to raise/lower. The black arrows between a moving platform and a generator indicates that the generator must be activated for the platform can move, this can be changed in the editor (and things can be set active or not by default).
