Folders
-------
Note: I should have used a folder hierarchy which is one step deeper to make it easier to split development files from 
internal files (like this .txt) and release files. 

On top there have to be 2 folders, one for the project itself, the other for media.
Project name doesn't matter - we call it hcraft1 here. Media folder _must_ be named media_hc1 (some scripts in build need that name).

/hcraft1 
Main folder which contains the executables. This is also the working directory for the application.

/hcraft1/doc
Development documentation as well as user documentation.

/hcraft1/ghosts
On PC versions users can exchange recordings of their best times by copying the files in there.

/hcraft1/libs 
All libraries which are needed except the standard c (clib) and standard c++ lib (stl). 
Building those libraries is done with scripts which are in build.

/hcraft1/media
Media used in development. Stuff like user-data will be written in there. For making releases the media_hc1 which is 2 level higher is used.

/hcraft1/sahders
ES2 shaders. They are necessary for Android, but also run on PC. 
When making Android pkg's they are copied into the media folder.

/hcraft1/releases
When new releases are made (with a script from tools) they are put into this folder. So this folder will contain
the version which are given out to the customers.

/hcraft1/src
Source code of the game

/hcraft1/tests
Contains xml's which describe automatic test.
Also the resulting bmp's of those tests are written in here.

/hcraft1/build
Build tools used for development. Mostly shell-scripts to rebuild the libraries from scratch. 
Also scripts to make releases for customers.
Also contains Android build tool-chain.

/media_hc1
Contains all media used in the game. It's in an own folder mainly for rights-reasons (only sources are free, media is not).

/media_hc1/media
Default media for all versions

/media_hc1/media_demo
Media changes needed for the demo versions (no longer really necessary as there isn't a demo anymore).

/media_hc1/i18n
Adapted media for international versions.
